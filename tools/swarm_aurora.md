description: 'The Swarm-Aurora project was designed to facilitated and drive the use
  of Swarm in auroral science and push Swarm beyond its primary mission objective
  to become a key instrument in auroral science research. The primary objective of
  Swarm-Aurora is to build a bridge between Swarm data, the Swarm science community,
  and optical images of the aurora collected primarily by ground-based All-Sky Imagers
  (ASIs).
