description: 'A pure-python implementation of the Ovation Prime 2010 auroral precipitation
  model


  Ovation Prime 2010, (described in Newell et al., 2009 and Newell et al. 2010) is
  a model which predicts the total energy flux, total number flux, and average characteristic
  energy of precipitating electrons and ions in the polar regions. A Maxwellian particle
  energy (and velocity) distribution is assumed for the calculation of average energy.
  The model was based on data from the Defense Meteorology Satellite Program spacecraft,
  using data beginning in 1985. These spacecraft carry a particle detector (SSJ) which
  is sensitive to particles with characteristic energies between 30 eV and 30 keV.

  Provenance of this implementation


  Ovation Pyme is a complete translation of the IDL (a proprietary programming language,
  owned by ExelisVis) version released in an open source format on Sourceforge by
  Janet Machol, Rob Redmon and Nathan Case of NOAA National Center for Environmental
  Information (NCEI)'
