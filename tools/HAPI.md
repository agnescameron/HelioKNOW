description: The Heliophysics Data Application Programmerâ€™s Interface (HAPI) specification
  provides a common framework being adopted by many data providers across heliophysics.
  The aim is to ease sharing of data between different services and support an interoperable
  ecosystem. All components are developed openly on GitHub where you will find client
  software in various languages (MATLAB, Java, IDL etc.) to access data from HAPI
  servers.
notes: 'Purpose is to provide an access layer to many data sets at NASA
