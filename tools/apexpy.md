description: This is a Python wrapper for the Apex fortran library by Emmert et al.
  [2010] [1], which allows converting between geodetic, modified apex, and quasi-dipole
  coordinates as well as getting modified apex and quasi-dipole base vectors (Richmond
  [1995] [2]). The geodetic system used here is WGS84. MLT calculations are also included.
  The package is free software (MIT license).
