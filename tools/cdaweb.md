description: 'The NASA/GSFC Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) bring you a new, World-Wide-Web-based
  system for viewing essentially ANY data produced in Common Data Format/CDF with
  the ISTP/IACG Guidelines. CDAWeb, the Coordinated Data Analysis (Workshop) Web,
  supports interactive plotting of variables from multiple instruments on multiple
  investigations simultaneously on arbitrary, user-defined time-scales. It also supports
  data retrieval in both CDF or ASCII format. '
notes: 'A database compiling many observing platforms


  Programmatic access (through SPEDAS, pySPEDAS, pysatNASA, SunPy)'
