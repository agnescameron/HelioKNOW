description: 'VirES for Swarm is a highly interactive data manipulation and retrieval
  interface for the ESA Swarm constellation mission products. It includes tools for
  studying various geomagnetic models by comparing them to the Swarm satellite measurements
  at given space weather and ionospheric conditions. '
notes: 'Built for time series


  Intended for event-based analyses (not large-scale data analyses) - is this correct?


  What are the components of VirES? The web server; viresclient (Python interface);
  JupyterBook (instructional/educational resources?)'
