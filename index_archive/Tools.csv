Ovation Prime 2010, (described in Newell et al., 2009 and Newell et al. 2010) is a model which predicts the total energy flux, total number flux, and average characteristic energy of precipitating electrons and ions in the polar regions. A Maxwellian particle energy (and velocity) distribution is assumed for the calculation of average energy. The model was based on data from the Defense Meteorology Satellite Program spacecraft, using data beginning in 1985. These spacecraft carry a particle detector (SSJ) which is sensitive to particles with characteristic energies between 30 eV and 30 keV.
