title: Curated Collections of Innovation Data Resources
layout: list
---

<p>Collections are curated resources aggregated by the community that address a specific theme in innovation research, and provide a space for discussing how different resources can be used in combination with one another. Some of the collections included here are curated in different places (e.g. the Lens Labs tools list, the Google Patents Index of Public Datasets), while others are curated on this site.</p>

<p>If you would like to curate a collection -- perhaps you work with multiple datasets in your research, or maybe your department keeps a list of useful tools -- this would be a great thing to share. You are welcome to contribute one yourself via Github (see instructions on the <a href="/about.html">about page</a>), or, if you would like some guidance please <a href="mailto:agnescam@mit.edu">get in touch</a>, we can help.</p>

<p>These pages are intentionally free-form, and you are welcome to link to any resources on or off this website (they don't need to be free and open, but it's useful to mention so if not!).</p>
