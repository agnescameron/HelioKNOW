description: Madrigal is an upper atmospheric science database used by groups throughout
  the world. Madrigal is a robust, World Wide Web based system capable of managing
  and serving archival and real-time data, in a variety of formats, from a wide range
  of upper atmospheric science instruments. Data at each Madrigal site is locally
  controlled and can be updated at any time, but shared metadata between Madrigal
  sites allow searching of all Madrigal sites at once from any Madrigal site.
