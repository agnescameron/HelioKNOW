description: 'The VRE is a cloud service based on Jupyter technology to lower the
  barrier to entry for researchers to use Swarm products. We provide the hardware
  and the software stack so that you can start programming immediately without configuring
  anything on your computer. Data and software are stored and executed in the cloud.


  The VRE is an extension of VirES (Virtual environments for Earth observation Scientists)
  - a server system and a graphical web interface to allow easy visualisation and
  manipulation of Swarm products (both data and geomagnetic models). With the VRE
  you are now able to bring the Jupyter & Python ecosystem to data retrieved via VirES.'
notes: 'Do research with the swarm viresclient tool (viresclient is a Python package
  which connects to a VirES server through the WPS interface and handles product requests
  and downloads. This enables easy access to ESAâ€™s Swarm mission data and models.
  This service is provided for ESA by EOX. )
