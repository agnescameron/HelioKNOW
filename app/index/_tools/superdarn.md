description: 'SuperDARN stands for Super Dual Auroral Radar Network. The network consists
  of more than 30 low-power HF radars that look into Earth''s upper atmosphere beginning
  at mid-latitudes and extending into the polar regions. The radars operate continuously
  and observe the motion of charged particles (plasma) in the ionosphere and other
  effects that provide scientists with information on Earth''s space environment.
  The knowledge gained from this work provides insight into space weather hazards
  including radiation exposure for high-altitude travelers and disruptions to communication
  networks, navigation systems (GPS), and electrical power grids.


  The SuperDARN Research Group at Virginia Tech (VT) collaborates with an international
  community of scientists and engineers to operate radars and share data. The VT Group
  operates five radars. For a summary of the radars and their affiliations, visit
  the Radar Maps/Tables/Links web page. '
