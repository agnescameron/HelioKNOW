description: 'Geospacepy-lite is a toolbox of loosely-related modules which were originally
  created for analyzing in-situ sensed electrodynamics and particle precipitation
  data from spacecraft, but are general-purpose enough to useful for various common
  geospace data analysis tasks.


  The dependacies of the package are limited to the core scientific python packages
  like the standard library, numpy, and matplotlib.'
