description: 'OCBpy is a Python module that converts between AACGM coordinates and
  a magnetic coordinate system that adjusts latitude and local time relative to the
  Open Closed field line Boundary (OCB). This is particulary useful for statistical
  studies of the poles, where gridding relative to a fixed magnetic coordinate system
  would cause averaging of different physical regions, such as auroral and polar cap
  measurements. '
