description: "Collaborative data science tool for high-latitude geospace observations\n\n
  AMGeO is a collaborative data science platform for the geospace science community
  for bringing together a diverse set of heterogeneous geospace observations from
  NSF-funded facility programs and individual community users to obtain complete maps
  of high-latitude ionospheric electrodynamics for scientific discovery and space
  weather research. The platform is made of the AMGeO open-source software and web
  application services that facilitate the data acquisition and pre-processing steps
  that are otherwise prohibitively labor-intensive. It is developed at the University
  of Colorado Boulder by the AMGeO Team, with support from the NSF Earth Cube program. "
notes: 'Type: Access Tool


  Currently AMGeO is capable of ingesting SuperDARN and SuperMAG data. In future AMGeO
  software releases, AMGeO will be able to use other types of data, such as Iridium
  magnetic fields provided by the AMPERE program'
